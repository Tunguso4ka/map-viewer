# Whats that?
Areas/* contains RMC14 Area info files.

Area Info File is a simple json file that holds every Area "Entity" from RMC-14 that exists on map, its name, its protections, and mini map.

Mini map is a list of strings. Each string is a Y line of tiles in game, each 2 symbols of string is one tile X.

I could've used simple PNG overlay, but it wouldn't allow me to have area names and distinct protections.
